## Working Through the Course

The `learn-to-code-with-rust` folder contains multiple directories. Each folder is an independent Cargo project with a  `Cargo.toml` file.

At the start of each course section, you'll find a note listing the Cargo project for that course.

For example, the next section is called "Variables and Mutability" and has a corresponding `variables-and-mutability` folder.
